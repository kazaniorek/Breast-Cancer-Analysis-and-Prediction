# Breast Cancer Analysis and Prediction

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to analyse and classify breast cancer cases using a medical dataset. It focuses on evaluating model performance, feature relevance, and interpreting predictions with LIME.

## Features

- Data loading and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature correlation and visualisation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Classification using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
- Model comparison based on accuracy and confusion matrix
- **Explainable AI**:
  - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to understand individual predictions

## Technologies

- Python
- scikit-learn
- LIME
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn lime matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. Open the notebook:
   - `Breast_Cancer_Assessment_30030295.ipynb`

3. Run all cells sequentially.

## Dataset

The dataset includes anonymised breast cancer medical features for classification into malignant or benign categories.
